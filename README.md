# HDRUK Avoidable Admissions Analytics

HDRUK Data Science Collaboration on Avoidable Admissions in the NHS.

Please see <https://mattstammers.github.io/hdruk_avoidable_admissions_collaboration_docs/> for more information.

## Project Setup

The project setup is based on an opinionated [cookiecutter datascience project](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) template.
There are a few additional components to ease development and facilitate a collaborative workspace.

The setup has only been tested on Windows 10.
Before setting this project up, the following requirements need to be met:

- Anaconda or Miniconda installed and access to the Anaconda Powershell prompt
- Mamba (`conda install mamba -n base`)
- Git

### Steps

1. Start Anaconda powershell prompt and navigate to the root of this folder.
2. Execute `./init.bat`
3. Activate the environment with `conda activate hdruk_aa`
4. Start JupyterLab with `jupyter-lab`
5. Alternatively open an IDE (e.g. Code) and set python environment to hdruk_aa

### Additional features

The project expects collaboration using `git` and GitHub and uses [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) git hooks
to help with identifying and resolving issues with code quality.
See `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for what features are enabled by default.

### Known issues

- `pandas-profiling` is not compatible with Python 3.11 yet. If this is critical, the options are either to downgrade Python to 3.10 or to use a separate environment with Python<=3.10 to run pandas-profiling. As pandas-profiling will only be used infrequently, the latter may be a better option. Suggestions welcome.

The following directories are not in version control and will need to be manually created by the user.

    ├── data
        ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
        ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
        ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
        └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.

Alternatively, create a `.env` file with database credentials, paths to data directories, etc. and
load this using `python-dotenv`.
See `.env.sample`  and <https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/> for how to do this.
Avoid hardcoding local paths in notebooks or code to ensure reproducibility between collaborators.

**DO NOT COMMIT CREDENTIALS TO VERSION CONTROL!**

**ENSURE NO PII IS EXPOSED BEFORE COMMITING TO VERSION CONTROL!**
