## Emergency Care Data Model

### Overview
Patient records for all emergency care attendances for adults (18 years + on day of admission) that had an admission date within the specified study period (see above).

Please check the coding of the variables against those linked to in the â€˜Coding/Classification systemâ€™ column, this is to ensure data (and therefore analysis) standardisation across sites.
