### Population of Interest

- Study period: `>=2021-10-01T00:00:00` to `<=2022-09-30T23:59:59`
- Patients:
    - Admitted Patient Care Dataset: All acute emergency admissions for adults (18 years + on day of admission) that had an admission date within the study period
    - Emergency Care Dataset: All patients attending ED during the study period.

### Criteria for those at high risk of avoidable admission:

The criteria for those at high risk of avoidable admission are considered to be:

* 36 ambulatory care sensitive conditions[^1]. Alternatively this resource can be accessed in the [Directory of Ambulatory
Emergency Care for Adults](https://www.ambulatoryemergencycare.org.uk/uploads/files/1/AEC-Directory%206th%20edition%20February%202018.pdf)
* Length of stay in hospital
* Where possible, investigation and treatment received
